Core Functionality:
This Python code implements a chat client application that enables users to:

Register: Create a new account with a username and password.
Log in: Access the application using their registered credentials.
Public Chat: Send and receive messages in a general chat with all connected users.
Private Chat: Initiate private conversations with specific users.

Code Structure:
The code is divided into several classes, each serving a specific purpose:

LoginWindow: Creates the login window, allowing users to input their username and password. Upon successful login, it opens the main chat window.
RegistrationWindow: Creates the registration window, enabling users to create new accounts.
ChatWindow: The main application window after login. It displays a list of online users, allows sending public messages, and facilitates private chats.
PrivateChat: Creates a separate window for private conversations.

How it Works:
Graphical User Interface: Tkinter is used to create the user interface with windows, buttons, text fields, and lists.
Server Connection: The client connects to a specified server using sockets.
Message Sending and Receiving: Messages are sent and received in a specific format (e.g., "login:username:password").
Event Handling: Events like button clicks and text input are handled to trigger actions.
Threading: A thread is used to continuously receive messages from the server, ensuring a responsive user interface.

Additional Features:
User List Updates: The client periodically requests an updated list of online users from the server.
Private Chats: Users can initiate private conversations by double-clicking on a username.
Error Handling: The code includes mechanisms to handle common errors like connection failures and authentication issues.
